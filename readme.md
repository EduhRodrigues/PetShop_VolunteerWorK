This is a volunteer project.

It consists of a web page that shows all the products of the establishment, how to get there, and a direct link to Whatsapp

The following image is from a project for a beginner Individual Microentrepreneur (MEI) who opened a pet food store.
 
I thought of doing something simple, but functional, useful and that would give visibility to the business and autonomy in the including and editing products list.
 
So I created a stylized Google Sheet with product image, description and price. Where the person can manage by themself from anywhere on the internet.
 
I created a simple and stylized web page for the business, incorporated the spreadsheet through the HTML element iframe (inline frame) and also added a link to open the store's Whatsapp service.
 
In order for customers to access the product page, or be directed to the store's Whatsapp, I created an interactive PDF "Business Card" with the appropriate links.
 
In addition, I suggested sharing the card with your contacts on messaging apps and social networks, and explained how to run an outreach campaign on Instagram and Facebook.
 
I was super happy that I was able to implement this solution, albeit simple.
 
I'm still thinking about implementing a robot that will do all the service via Whatsapp.
I already made the robot, there's still time!
